What does an iterator do for a BST? 

Start with an empty BST and then insert 5, 9, 4, 13, 6. 

What order would you get from an iterator on the tree? 
Teresa: 4 5 13 6 9     ad-hoc 
Daniel: 5 4 13 9 6 <-- breadth-first 
Liz:    5 4 13 9 6     depth-first 
Cam:                   in order 

def in-order(tree): 
  if tree is null: stop
  else: 
    in-order(tree.left)
    print tree.value
    in-order(tree.right) 

4 5 6 9 13
